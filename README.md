# Py3PDF

A fork of the popular PyPDF2 library adding support to write
to compression-based file descriptors (ex. gzip.open). Codebase
is also being updated to support newer versions of Python 3.

A pure-python PDF library capable of splitting, merging together,
cropping, and transforming the pages of PDF files. It can also add
custom data, viewing options, and passwords to PDF files.
It can retrieve text and metadata from PDFs as well
as merge entire files together.

## Examples

Please see the `Sample_Code` folder.


## Tests
Py3PDF includes a test suite built on the unittest framework. All tests are located in the "Tests" folder.
Tests can be run from the command line by:

```bash
python -m unittest Tests.tests
```
